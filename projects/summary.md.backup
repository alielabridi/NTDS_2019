# Project Summary: Spammers on Social Networks

## Motivation:
The goal of the project is to implement a model/algorithm capable of classifying users of a social media network as "spammers" or "not spammers" based on their interactions with other users and a limited set of features.

## Dataset:
We opted for the "Social Spammers" dataset from UC Stanta Cruz. The dataset is a graph of interaction between the users of the social network Tagged.com.
- It contains 5.6M users and 858M links between them. Each user has 4 features and is labeled as "spammer" or "not spammer".
- Each link represents an action between two users. The network contains 7 anonymized types of links.

## Graph:
Unsurprisingly:
- Vertices: Users
- Edges: Interactions


## Challenges:
- Size of the dataset: due to its large volume (>2 Gb), the dataset can't be processed easily as is. Sampling methods may be necessary
- Features: Apart from the types of interactions that, there are only 4 features tied to the users, meaning "classic" classifying approaches might not be good enough

## Engineering:
// We should put here what techniques and tools we think we'll have to use and a lot of buzzwords

## Conclusion:
