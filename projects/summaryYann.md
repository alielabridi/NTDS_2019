## Motivation:
The goal of the project is to implement a model/algorithm capable of classifying users of a social media network as "spammers" or "not spammers" based on their interactions with other users and a limited set of features.

## Dataset:
We opted for the "Social Spammers" dataset from UC Stanta Cruz. The dataset is a graph of interaction between the users of the social network Tagged.com.
The data are organized as follows. We have a dataset containing 5.6 million users (23.2 MB: userId, sex, timePassedValidation, ageGroup, Spammer/Not-spammer label) and a dataset containing 856 million relationships between users (6.8 GB: day, time_ms, src, dst, relation). These relationships correspond to links between users. In other words, it represents their interactions. These relationships have 8 different types filled in by a "relationship" ID.


## Proposal:
In order to perform the data acquisition, we must select a subset of the data to reduce the excessive size of the initial datasets.  
The data organization invites to build several graphs according to the number of types of relationships that we will have kept after reducing the size of the dataset. If we create a directed-graph per relationship, we will have each graph representing users as nodes, and the relationships between users as links. In this way we will be able to generate features with different graph analysis methods: Pagerank, Degree, k-core, Connected Components, Triangle Count...
In this way we will be able to use the data to compare the graphs according to the type of the associated relationship. These comparisons can be made at the graph properties level, their identified types, node properties and attribute analysis. We will also visualize the graphs in order to obtain a qualitative analysis.
These analyses will allow us to develop operating methods to compare different classifiers using the tools seen in progress according to the chosen relationships and graph analysis methods. These methods will initially be based on existing work on the detection of spammers: SVM, K-NN.
