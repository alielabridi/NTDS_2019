# Instructions

Please make sure that the features have been extracted in `../data/`, especially `relations.csv` and `userdata_with_features.csv`. The notebook is quite straightforward, but does take a lot of time to run from top to bottom.

## Added dependencies

if already running the `ntds_2019` environment, please add the following:
```
conda update scikit-learn
conda install xgboost
```
